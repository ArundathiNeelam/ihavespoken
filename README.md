## 🏗️ Building the Contract

To build the contract, follow these steps:

1. Go to the contract folder in the project directory.
2. Run the following command to build the contract:

   ```shell
   cargo build --release
   ```

   This command compiles the contract code and generates the necessary artifacts.

3. Next, you can run the tests for the contract using the following command:

   ```shell
   cargo test --release
   ```

   Running the tests ensures that the contract functions as intended and helps identify any potential issues or bugs.

4. Lastly, if you need to perform additional tasks related to the contract, you can use the `make all` command. This command executes a predefined set of actions specified in the project's Makefile.

   ```shell
   make all
   ```

   The `make all` command could include tasks such as deploying the contract to a test network or performing additional compilation steps, depending on the specific requirements of the project.
